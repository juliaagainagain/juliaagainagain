Computer Science student fascinated by the world of aviation ✈︎ 
My curiosity goes beyond coding: I’m always seeking to understand how things work, from the fundamentals of programming to the mysteries of the universe. When I’m not developing something new, I enjoy reading, studying philosophy, psychology, and tourism — I love having multidisciplinary knowledge, which is quite evident in the various in my codes — I’ve code about different areas of life!
